I am Aochuan Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student from [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My primary area of interest and the focal point of my research is centered around the development and improvement of **scalable** and **trustworthy** machine learning algorithms. These are integral to handle the ever-increasing size of datasets and ensure that our models are not only efficient but also reliable and interpretable.

I originate from Sichuan, China, which I consider to be the finest location on Earth. Being a proud Sichuanese, I hold a deep affection for my accent and am eager to assist my friends in exploring the captivating aspects of Sichuanese culture. I warmly invite you to join me for a Sichuanese language practice session.

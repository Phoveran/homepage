I am Aochuan Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student from OPTML Group at Michigan State University, supervised by Prof. Sijia Liu. My research focuses on the scalable and trustworthy ML algorithms. In general, my research spans the areas of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL), optimization theory, computer vision, and security. These research topics provide a solid foundation for my current and future research: Making AI system safe and scalable.
